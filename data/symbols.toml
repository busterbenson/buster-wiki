[adoration-of-coin]
name = "Adoration of Coin"
desc = "The RWS Page, Knight, and Queen of Pentacles seem to romanticize the giant coin in their hands, holding it like a beloved treasure. There's something a bit silly and superficial about this level of reverence for money. As the court cards progress you can see how once you’ve attained the object of your quest, caution is increasingly required to protect, maintain, and preserve what you’ve won."

Their domain extends beyond money and finance to all physical things, including the human body. Coins explore your attitude toward resources of all kinds: what you’ve been given, and what you do with it. In RWS-influenced decks, Coins are often called Pentacles. A pentacle’s design (with the upright star in the middle that represents the human body) reminds us that physical blessings, from possessions to our bodies, are to be used for higher purposes.

[columns]
name = "Boaz and Jachin"
desc = "The B (Boaz) and J (Jachin) often seen on the columns to either side of the Priestess are the two pillars of Solomon’s Temple.

cards = ['wands-03']

[distant-village]
name = "Distant Village"
desc = "Some RWS-inspired decks depict a distant village in the background of the 10 of Wands and on the 2 of Coins. The village is the light at the end of the tunnel: a reminder that the destination is close at hand. The 'way out' may be as simple as declining an opportunity you lack the time or energy to complete. In the case of the 4 of coins, the distant village can be interpreted as a city that the king holds dear and is unable to let go of, much like the coins in his arms."

cards = ['major-04']

[five-figures]
name = "In RWS-inspired decks, five figures on the 5 of Wands confront each other. Are they fighting? Are they dancing? Are three watching while the other two battle to the death?

cards = ['wands-05']

[flags-and-banners]
name = "Flags and Banners"
desc = "Many illustrations for the 6 of Wands card show Wands with flags and banners attached. These are visual signs sent to recognize and appreciate what you have to offer."

[hand-of-god]
name = "Hand of God"
desc = "On the Aces in Marseilles and RWS-inspired decks, a heavenly hand extends from the clouds, offering the viewer the suit’s distinctive marker. When opportunity comes your way, take advantage of it; the hand that extends an offer can always withdraw it."

cards = ['major-00']

[juggler]
name = "Juggler"
desc = "In the Marseilles deck, the Magician is a juggler, known for his slight of hand. In RWS-inspired decks, the 2 of Coins depicts a juggler carefully balancing two Coins joined by a lemniscate (infinity symbol).

cards = ['wands-07']

[knight]
name = "Knight"
desc = "Knights embody extremes. The Knight of Coins could be a miser or a spendthrift, depending on which way his energy flows. The Knight of Cups could be emotionally-intelligent or overly sentimental. The Knight of Swords rushes towards insight, but might skip over important facts in the process. The Knight of Wands is motivated to rush to action, but might never be able to build something that lasts, like the pyramids behind him."

[land-and-water]
name = "Land and Water"
desc = "Occult decks frequently draw Temperance with one foot on stable land and one foot in emotional water. A dive-in-or-get-off-the-dock approach assumes extremes are the only options, but they aren't. On the Star card, the figure pours the Water of Life over both land and water, "

[mandalora]
name = "Mandalora"
desc = "Both the Marseilles and RWS-inspired decks surround the central figure with a wreath, or mandalora. Like the oroborous, the snake that swallows its own tail, the mandalora has no beginning or end. Its shape also suggests the number zero -- the designation of the Fool."

cards = ['major-21']

[magicians-tools]

name = "The Moon"
desc = "In any of its many phases. The Priestess is closely associated with the moon and, by extension, with all lunar cycles.

[mounted-swords]

desc = "The three Swords mounted on the wall of the 4 of Swords suggest the knight’s rest is a deliberate one -- a course of action deliberately chosen. The single Sword in hand suggests opportunity.

Quiet time can be used for research and personal growth, enhancing the work you do when more physically active."

[nudity]
name = "Nudity"
desc = "Nudity communicates innocence, openness, and shamelessness. On some cards, like the Star and Lovers cards, this is a good thing. On others, like the Devil card, it's framed as a weakness."

name = "Overburdened Figure"
desc = "Most RWS-inspired decks depict the figure in 10 of Wands as a stooped, overburdened figure. He has gone as far as sheer will can take him; he is on the verge of collapse. There comes a point when too much is too much, and it may be time to re-evaluate the approach to the problem."
cards = ['wands-10']

[partially-overturned-cups]
name = "Partially Overturned Cups"

[pierced-heart]
name = "Pierced Heart"
desc = "This imagery on the 3 of Swords, adapted from one of the earliest illustrated decks, doesn’t require a great deal of interpretation. It’s association with heartbreak and disappointment is clear to everyone who sees it."
cards = ['swords-03']

[pomegranates]
name = "Pomegranates"

cards = ['major-15']

[rack-of-swords]
name = "Rack of Swords"

variations = ['swords']
cards = ['swords-09']

[ram]

desc = "Scales have long been a symbol of balance and evaluation, as seen in the Justice card. The Egyptian god Ma’at weighed souls to determine purity of heart. In the 6 of Coins, there's a man with scales doling out charity to grateful recipients.

name = "Sneaky Figure"
desc = "RWS-inspired illustrations of the 7 of Swords often depict a thief tip-toeing away with stolen goods.

[threatening-wands]
name = "Threatening Wands"
desc = "On the 7 of Wands from RWS-inspired decks, we often see a lone figure threatened by six rather threatening Wands. Six is the number of collaboration, suggesting that many people have come together to launch an attack.
