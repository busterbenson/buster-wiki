Here's a very simple way to use tarot that will hopefully be interesting even to people who are very skeptical about its association with scammers, pseudo-science, and other sketchy things. Thing of a domain of your life that you are having trouble grappling with (relationships, work, personal growth, etc). Formulate a question like "What new lens might help me think about (my relationship, my work situation, my personal problem, etc)?"

Scan the cards below with this question in mind, and pick one that feels like it might be a clue to help you think about it a bit more. Don't think about it too much... just go with whatever feels right intuitively from System 1 (the quick-thinking part of your brain that is tough to access directly).
