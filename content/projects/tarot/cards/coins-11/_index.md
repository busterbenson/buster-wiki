personality    = "Though fascinated with the physical realm, the Page of Coins may lack the experience or information needed to handle money or human sexuality with responsibility and confidence. He or she may overcompensate for this by wasting money, abusing his or her health, or over-indulging in or obsessing on various forms of physical pleasure."

meaning_light  = "Learning the value of a dollar. Starting a savings plan. Taking the first steps toward getting out of debt. Learning new physical tasks. Discovering your sexuality. Launching a diet, a weight-lifting program, or a health-related effort. Learning by doing."

meaning_shadow = "Trying to appear healthier or wealthier than you really are. Spending money carelessly. Living strictly for today, with no thought of tomorrow. Possessing immature attitudes toward sex and sexuality. Using wealth or beauty as an excuse for not having to learn and grow."

correspondence_affirmation 	= "I am physically and financially responsible."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character must compensate for or learn from an earlier financial or sexual impropriety."

advice_relationships 	 = "Don’t rush into sexual situations that make you uncomfortable or that push your limits. Give a relationship time to flourish before opening a joint checking account. Lending money is a sure way to poison friendships and relationships. Before starting something new, ask “What’s in this for me?”"

advice_work 					 = "Accepting lower pay as a means of gaining experience makes sense when starting your career—but experienced workers should view such arrangements with skepticism. Know what you’re worth. Look for opportunities to learn while doing. Subject all work to the practicality test."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Consider what role your faith should play in making financial and sexual decisions. To what extent would your financial or sexual activity differ if you were not on your current spiritual path? Your body is a precious gift; treat it as such. Keep material blessings in perspective."

advice_personal_growth = "Whatever our station in life, we can always be better stewards of the blessings we’ve received. Do old habits threaten your health? Set them aside. Today, make a point to take special care of whatever you’ve been given."

advice_fortune_telling = "This card represents a young man or woman with an earthy, practical demeanor, likely born an Aries, Taurus, or Gemini, who playfully encourages you to take financial or sexual risks."

questions	= ["Do I long for more financial or worldly success? What new experiences might increase your chances of achieving this?", "How might hands-on learning play a role in your situation?", "What’s the most practical choice I could make in this moment?"]
