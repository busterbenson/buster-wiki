meaning_light  = "Giving time, money, or effort to a charity. Taking part in a group effort. Lending your resources to others without expecting anything in return. Making sure everyone is treated equally. Working together toward a common goal. Redistributing wealth, time, or attention. Tithing. Sharing credit for your success."

meaning_shadow = "Making a loan as a means of gaining control over someone. Using charitable acts to draw attention to yourself. Dividing work or resources unfairly. Failing to do your part in a group effort. Ignoring obligations and commitments."

correspondence_astrological = "Taurus"
correspondence_affirmation  = "Knowing I will receive more, I share my resources freely."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character wins by cooperating instead of competing."

advice_relationships 	 = "In a healthy relationship, partners help each other. Healthy partners agree on rules for dividing up chores, financial responsibilities, and social roles—and then honor those commitments. Define what equality means for you, and help each other achieve it."

advice_work 					 = "Learn to delegate. Many people, working together, can achieve more than one person, working alone. So what if some people contribute less and still get credit? Good managers will recognize star contributors and reward them accordingly."

advice_spirituality 	 = "A mature soul seeks to come to the aid of others. This may involve traditional charity: giving time, money, or effort. Don’t forget, though, that prayers and compassionate meditation can also change the world for good. Whatever form of service your spiritual path encourages, offer it with sincerity and regularity."

advice_personal_growth = "Charity is based on a simple principle: we should all look out for each other. Self-interest comes naturally; interest in others and their well-being is the hallmark of maturity. Putting the needs of others first can ease your progress toward a balanced life."

advice_fortune_telling = "When you need help, ask for it. Remember, though: what you receive may be limited by what you’ve given to others in the past."

questions	= ["What small gifts could make a big difference to someone?", "How do you feel about charity? About giving it? About receiving it?", "How can you know if you're treating others fairly?", "What can you give that no one else can?"]
