personality    = "The Queen of Swords can represent anyone who wants to encourage others (Queen) to be brighter and more communicative (Swords). The Queen may also represent the tendency to be more tactful than objective, or the need to express information more politely than precisely."

meaning_shadow = "Knowing exactly what to say to destroy another person. Withholding critical information. Using a barbed tongue to upset others. Employing sarcasm. Mimicking others unkindly. Making light of the less fortunate. Being disrespectful. Failing to use the talent you’ve been given."

correspondence_element 			= "Water of Air"
correspondence_affirmation 	= "I make the truth easier to hear."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character must deliver news that is difficult for others to receive with grace. Alternatively, the Main Character must confront the less desirable aspects of his or her personality."

advice_relationships 	 = "You can’t change other people, but you can provide gentle prompts designed to help them be the best they can be. Know the difference in supporting and nagging. Know, too, that requested advice is always prized more highly than unsolicited observations. Until you’re invited to speak, hold your tongue."

advice_work 					 = "Harsh criticism crushes morale, but finely-tuned words of praise can enhance performance and elicit remarkable productivity. Identify what must be changed, but express that change in terms of growth and benefit. Instead of problems, see challenges. Instead of deficits, see opportunities."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Practice the delivery of praise. When you receive blessings, voice your thanks. When others work for you, show your bright spirit by acknowledging their contributions. Whatever the situation, strive to be the soul of encouragement."

advice_personal_growth = "Your insights, opinions, and attitudes influence others more than you know. Express your thoughts with care, making sure you phrase your observations in ways that encourage growth. If you need encouragement, encourage others to give it."
