meaning_light  = "Thinking over your plans before putting them into action. Pausing to meditate or clear your mind. Taking time to understand someone or something before criticizing it. Resting. Occupying your thoughts with a healthy distraction."

meaning_shadow = "Failing to think things through. Mistaking procrastination for thoughtfulness. Adopting a point of view and refusing to reconsider your conclusions, even when presented with refuting evidence. Allowing chaos and whimsy to dominate your thoughts."

correspondence_planet 			= "Jupiter"
correspondence_astrological = "Libra"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I think before taking action."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character withdraws and spends time in quiet contemplation before taking action."

advice_relationships 	 = "Taking a break from each other might restore some perspective. Rather than over-analyze everything, clear your mind and take things at face value for once. If you can’t achieve peace together, there’s no shame in saying you need a rest."

advice_work 					 = "Running at top speed all the time wears down the most capable individuals. Insist on time to recharge your creative batteries. On even the most hectic days, steal ten minutes to be still and disconnect. See time off as an investment in maintaining your sharp edge."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Withdrawal from the world can help you achieve remarkable perspective. Schedule time for quiet contemplation. Rather than ponder solutions, just breathe—and let Spirit sort things out."

advice_personal_growth = "A mature person knows the value of stillness. Before taking action, set aside time to simply be. Associate calmness and focus with specific postures or breathing patterns, and you’ll be able to summon a clear state of mind on demand."

advice_fortune_telling = "Don’t make any decision now. Wait, and you’ll be glad you did."

questions	= ["What opportunities might open for you if you made a conscious decision to integrate relaxation into your strategy?", "How long has it been since you deliberately took a “time out?”", "What might present itself from stillness, if you allowed it to unfold?", "What would happen if you simply refused to make a decision today?"]
