meaning_light  = "Doing your best. Bringing enthusiasm and zeal to your work. Making an effort to be the best you can be. Finding the work that is right for you. Taking care of the small details. Becoming a finely skilled craftsperson. Building something with your hands. Making a handmade gift."

correspondence_astrological = "Virgo"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I give myself wholeheartedly to the task of the moment."
correspondence_story 				= "The Main Character is shown to be the very best at his or her chosen vocation."

advice_relationships 	 = "Discover what your partner loves or needs and make a special effort to deliver those gifts, words, or service on a regular basis. Consider the value of a handmade gift. Partners should look for ways to demonstrate their dedication to each other. Busy? Make sure a request from your partner or friend rises to the top of your “To Do” list."

advice_work 					 = "All too often, compressed schedules demand we do “just enough.” Today, try going beyond the bare minimum. Add that extra touch. Devote a little personal time to completing your work. Even if the task is an ordinary one, strive to make today’s product extraordinary. Others may not notice the difference—but you will."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Rituals can feel silly, and formal prayer can feel stiff and unnatural. Today, though, invest a little extra time and energy into your spiritual observations. Choose something to wear that reflects your faith. Acquire a special item for a home altar. Be in the moment, devoting extra attention to the small details of your faith."

advice_personal_growth = "Instead of just getting by, a mature person recognizes that every project and every interaction is a reflection of character. What would recent projects say about you? With an eye toward improving your image and reputation, how might your work and speech need to change?"

advice_fortune_telling = "Stop over-analyzing, researching, and outlining. Buckle down and get the work done."

What about that work appeals to you?"]
