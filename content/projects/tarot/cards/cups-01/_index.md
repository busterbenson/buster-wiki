meaning_light  = "Trusting your feelings. Opening yourself to spirit. Accepting and returning affection. Getting in touch with what motivates you. Taking advantage of an opportunity to express love to others. Listening to the still, small voice."

meaning_shadow = "Hiding your feelings. Spurning an opportunity to love or be loved. Numbing yourself to spiritual yearnings. Rejecting the counsel of your heart. Becoming a puppet of your own emotions. Indulging in hysteria or obsession."

correspondence_planet 			= ""
correspondence_astrological = "Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I listen to the counsel of my heart."
correspondence_story 				= "The Main Character meets a love interest or discovers his or her true calling."

advice_relationships 	 = "This is an opportunity to set logic aside and allow actions to be guided by feelings alone. Irrational? Perhaps. But in certain matters, logic does not apply. Be romantic. Be spiritual. This moment is a chance to see romance as an expression of spirituality, and vice-versa."

advice_work 					 = "How fulfilling is your work? If you’re going through the motions, this card challenges you to get back in touch with what delights you. Find a way to integrate your labor with your dreams. If you’re already fulfilled, watch for an opportunity to take your satisfaction to the next level."

advice_spirituality 	 = "On rare occasions, Heaven opens, and the Hand of God offers us the opportunity to experience unexpected spiritual highs. Pay close attention to the events around you; one is a seed—an opportunity to be uniquely and totally immersed in the work and power of Spirit."

advice_personal_growth = "How comfortable are you with expressions of emotion? Of faith? This card challenges you to be more open with both. A centered person freely shares what he or she feels, and a truly spiritual person can share his or her faith in natural, non-aggressive ways. Give both a try."

advice_fortune_telling = "Romance is in the cards! A new relationship or marriage is just around the corner. Prayers are answered."

questions	= ["When you see the Ace, what’s your first impression? What will the cup contain? What actions are you expected to take?", "What might your spiritual quest be? What hidden truths should you pursue?", "What am I feeling right now?", "How would I go about opening myself to spiritual guidance?", "What motivates me the most—pleasure or pain? Why?"]
