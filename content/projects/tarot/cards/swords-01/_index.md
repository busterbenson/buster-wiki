meaning_light  = "Making objective decisions. Applying logic. Reasoning your way out of a difficult situation. Solving puzzles. Thinking things through. Emphasizing the facts. Clearing your mind. Seeking clarity."

correspondence_astrological = "Libra, Aquarius, Gemini"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I take the time to think things through."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character must make an important decision that will determine his or her ultimate fate."

advice_relationships 	 = "Set your emotions aside for the moment and look at your relationship from an objective point of view. Would a judge or jury say this relationship is performing as it should? You’re facing a difficult decision; make it with your head, not your heart."

advice_work 					 = "Cut through emotionalism and get to the facts. In this situation, the devil’s in the details. What happened and when? Slay some sacred cows, stop the blame game, and get down to brass tacks. What are the objectives? Where are you in relationship to your goals?"

advice_spirituality 	 = "Your relationship with Spirit should inform all your decisions. Here’s an opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in your inner life to decisions that impact your outer life. If you were to make this decision for someone else, what verdict would you render?"

advice_personal_growth = "At some point, we must go from seeking advice to making our own decisions. Gather information, draw on the experience of mentors, and get the facts…but be prepared, as a mature individual, to make decisions and own the consequences."

advice_fortune_telling = "The time to make a choice is now. Stop wavering and do what you know is best."

questions	= ["If your question were asked of your Higher Self, freed from petty, earthly concerns, what answer might be given?", "When you see this Ace of Swords, what’s your first impression? Is the Sword being offered as a gift, or wielded as a weapon? What higher authority for truth does it point to? Is it too heavy to bear, or something you could manage?", "If I made my decision purely based on reason and logic, what would my decision be?", "What do I think about my own problem-solving ability?", "Who can supply me with the pure and simple facts?"]
