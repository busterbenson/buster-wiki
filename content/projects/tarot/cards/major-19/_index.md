advice_relationships 	 = "You’re turning heads without realizing it. Attention is coming your way -- and you deserve it! The admiration of others is a warm glow, so bask in it while you can. As all things begin to revolve around you, take care you don’t get blinded or burned by your own brilliance."

advice_work 					 = "With the proper strategy, you’re all set to be the golden boy (or girl). Approval and praise are the order of the day.
