correspondence_affirmation  = "I use inner vision as a tool for growth."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character is hindered by unreasonable expectations or unfounded fears. Alternatively, the Main Character insists on remaining true to his or her original vision."

advice_relationships 	 = "Comparing your friendships and relationships to unrealistic, Hollywood-produced fantasies is a sure-fire formula for disappointment. Rather than imagine what things ought to be, face how things are…and then take the steps necessary to make your relationships more rewarding."

advice_work 					 = "Plan for contingencies. At the same time, don’t allow “what might be” to distract you from “what is.” Unless it’s your job to build castles in the sky, be sure to invest more effort in hard work than sweet dreams."

questions	= ["In your situation, what is the worst possible outcome? What’s the best possible outcome? How are hopes and fears shaping your thoughts about the challenge of the moment?", "As engaging as dreams and fantasies can be, imagination without action is wasted energy. How might things change if you fantasized less about outcomes and more about new ways to take action?", "What do you want most? What do you fear most? How are these related?", "How is your imagination working for you? Against you?", "How might a clearer personal vision help you choose a single cup from the many available?"]
