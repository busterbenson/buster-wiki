meaning_light  = "Sharing in a great celebration. Sharing in a communal sense of achievement and success. Preparing for a party. Working together toward a common goal. Giving or winning awards."

advice_relationships 	 = "Have you been together for ten years? Celebrate. Have you been together ten days? Celebrate. Do something to recognize the contribution of both partners. Alone? Celebrate yourself."

advice_work 					 = "Assign duties, delegate, and get out of the way. Allow others to contribute, even if their contributions aren’t exactly up to your personal standards. When projects end, thank everyone involved in a meaningful way."
