meaning_light  = "Refusing to make a decision without getting the facts. Exploring both sides of an argument. Arguing passionately for what you believe in. Weighing the issues. Encouraging the open exchange of ideas. Discussing political or religious issues without getting “hot under the collar.”"

meaning_shadow = "Rejecting evidence that conflicts with dearly-held beliefs. Arguing with others just for the sake of doing so. Nit-picking. Putting off a decision because you’re afraid to face the consequences. Preventing others from getting the information they need to make good decisions."

correspondence_planet 			= "Moon"
correspondence_astrological = "Libra"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I strive to see all sides of every issue."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character must defend his or her decisions. Alternatively, the Main Character rejects critical information and makes a bad decision."

advice_relationships 	 = "You may be in denial; if so, you’re only fooling yourself. You serve your own best interests by seeing things as they really are. Stop avoiding unpleasant confrontations. An honest disagreement is better than a false peace."

advice_work 					 = "Consider all the facts before making your decision. Once you’ve made your decision, be prepared to defend it with well-reasoned arguments. If others continue to reject your counsel, be aware that you may have to let go, sit back, and let time prove that you were right, after all."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Spiritual maturity demands we see ourselves as we really are—and love ourselves in spite of our shortcomings. Rather than debate whether or not you’re “good enough,” be thankful for the progress you’ve made thus far. Avoid beating yourself up with high-minded standards of perfection."

advice_personal_growth = "What are you avoiding? Growth awaits the souls brave enough to cast aside blindfolds and see the situation for what it really is. Get past this personal stalemate by taking time to think clearly about what you want and where you’re going."

advice_fortune_telling = "Sometimes, the only way to win is to not play the game. You’re stuck for now; let time pass before taking action."

questions	= ["To what extent are your own decisions informed by logic? By emotion?", "In your situation, is it more important to think fast or to deliberate slowly?

Could meditation help find an answer?", "In your situation, is it more important to think fast or to deliberate slowly? How can you declare a truce between frenzied thoughts and the need to think carefully? Could meditation help find an answer?", "What information do I need to get past this impasse?", "How can I get past being defensive and see the facts?", "What viewpoints, other than my own, play a role in this situation?"]
