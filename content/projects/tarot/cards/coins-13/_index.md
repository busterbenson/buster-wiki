personality    = "The Queen of Coins can represent anyone who wants to encourage others (Queen) to appreciate the pleasures of the physical world (Coins). The Queen may also represent the tendency to be more materially-minded than spiritually-minded, or the need to pursue personal comfort at almost any cost."

meaning_light  = "Appreciating fine food, fine wine, beautiful art, beautiful bodies, or any of the better things in life. Reveling in healthy sexuality. Treating yourself. Splurging on the occasional “nice to have” item. Rewarding someone with compensation above and beyond expectations. Having it all."

meaning_shadow = "Indulging in gluttony or greediness. Becoming insatiable. Blunting the impact of treats by indulging in them too often. Providing physical comfort without providing for emotional needs. Allowing a feeling of entitlement to distort your gratitude for what you’re given."

correspondence_planet				= "Earth"
correspondence_affirmation 	= "I relish the best this world has to offer."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character must avoid being lulled into complacency by the temptations of “the good life."

advice_relationships 	 = "Over time, passion may give way to comfort; both of these incarnations of love have their benefits. A luxury shared with others becomes even more luxurious. Don’t over-think sex and relationships. Instead, set reasonable limits and embrace what your body yearns for."

advice_work 					 = "Strive to incorporate special touches and little extras in your products and services today. These may require more time or resources to complete, but the results will be well worth the investment. Don’t be satisfied with anything less than the very best product possible."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Cocoon yourself in spiritual protection. Say an extra prayer. Burn an expensive stick of incense and savor the sweet aroma. Light a scented candle. Enjoy a ritual dinner. Alternatively, heighten your appreciation for your blessings by engaging in a period of voluntary simplicity. What can you do without?"

advice_personal_growth = "How often do you cheat yourself by opting for the less expensive, the less suitable, or the less than perfect? There’s great pleasure in sacrificing for, saving for, and acquiring something “just right.” You may find anticipating something is more pleasurable than having it."

advice_fortune_telling = "This card represents a woman with an expansive, sensual nature, likely born between December 13th and 31st, who uses sensual appeal and the promise of reward to sway others to her point of view."

questions	= ["What might happen if you emulated the Queen of Coins' attention to sensual detail?", "What might happen if you were to put your own best side forward, thrusting it into the spotlight for all to admire?", "Money and health come and go. How can you cultivate a level of comfort that transcends sudden and unexpected changes in your circumstances?", "How do you define luxury?", "What would you have to give up in order to 'have it all?'"]
