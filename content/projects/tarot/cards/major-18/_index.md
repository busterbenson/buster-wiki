advice_relationships 	 = "Moonlight becomes you, so don’t be afraid to indulge in a little romantic lunacy. Navigating your way to a fulfilling relationship involves risks. Some people will say you’re crazy. Pay attention to your instincts, surround yourself with loyal guides, and make your move."

advice_work 					 = "Avoid linear/logical approaches and go with your gut. Brainstorm. Put the rules aside and use your imagination. What would happen if restrictions were removed? What might happen? What could happen? A little lunacy can be a good thing; blow off steam, change your habits, and try working in a different light."
