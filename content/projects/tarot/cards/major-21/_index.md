meaning_light  = "Having it all. Knowing and loving yourself as completely as possible. Seeing the interconnection of all things and people. Enhancing your perspective. Living life to its fullest. Understanding the meaning of life."

meaning_shadow = "Allowing greed and envy to prevent you from enjoying what you do possess. Failing to see the larger design in ordinary events. Believing that everything that exists can be touched, counted, or measured. Failing to see the divine reflected in those around you."

advice_relationships 	 = "With mutual trust and effort, very different people can come together to create a reality greater than the sum of its parts. Once you have a taste of what can be, settling for less will be difficult. Keep in mind, though, that a dream of perfection can foster dissatisfaction with an otherwise perfectly good relationship."

advice_work 					 = "Synergy! It’s possible for everyone involved to work together in harmony to create something better than any one person could produce on his or her own. Encourage people to share ideas. Allow others to share in the investment—and the glory. Unite and meet your goals."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Enlightenment is a goal; reaching it is bliss. Rather than beat yourself up for falling short, celebrate your progress. Meantime, keep in mind the lesson of the Tarot: Even as we reach one level of enlightenment, we become a fool again."

advice_personal_growth = "For most challenges, both intuitive and logical approaches exist. Most of us favor one over the other, but the secret to true mastery involves learning to wield both with perfect facility. Identify your least favorite approach, and then speed your growth by giving it special attention."

advice_fortune_telling = "Winning the lottery. Getting your heart’s desire. Having everything you ever imagined having."
