correspondence_story 				= "On the verge of giving up, the main character withdraws, seeking clarity in isolation. He or she may receive advice from a wise person."

advice_relationships 	 = "Don’t be afraid of being alone. Even the closest companions need some time apart. Being involved in a partnership does not eliminate your need to be your own person. To better please others, first learn how to please yourself."

advice_work 					 = "Sometimes, you have to close the door, forward calls to voice mail, and shut down your email client to get things done. Demand the space and time you need to get your assignment done. If you’re overwhelmed, consider bringing in a consultant or an experienced aid."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Learn to be still. Doing so is a challenge in today’s hurly-burly world, but the skill offers many benefits. Focus on meditation; condition yourself to slow your thoughts and lower your blood pressure with a few measured breaths. Daily practice will make a huge difference in the quality of your life."

advice_personal_growth = "To be the best you can be, you must know who you really are. Reject the definitions others project on you. Search within. What do you really value? What do you really want to achieve? Empower yourself by embracing yourself, warts and all."

advice_fortune_telling = "A period of loneliness begins. One partner in a relationship departs. A search for love or money proves fruitless."

How can I enlist his or her help?"]
