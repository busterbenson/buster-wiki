correspondence_story 				= "A skilled advisor or capable initiate teaches the main character the secrets he or she needs to succeed."

advice_relationships 	 = "A relationship should be more than just going through the motions. Seek the deeper meaning of small gestures and daily chores. Emphasize signs that those involved have real faith in the partnership. If necessary, seek guidance from a spiritual leader or counselor."

advice_work 					 = "Seek training or a mentor, particularly if you are having difficulty understanding a complex assignment or when adjusting to new professional surroundings. See your daily work as an expression of your faith. Take traditional routes instead of innovative, unproven measures."

advice_spirituality 	 = "See familiar spiritual symbols in a new light by pursuing a deeper understanding of them. If you’re a lone practitioner, consider the value of joining a like-minded group or learning from a worthy teacher. What are the larger truths behind the rituals or stories you’ve learned?"

Who enforces them? Why?", "How might an experienced guide impact this situation?"]
