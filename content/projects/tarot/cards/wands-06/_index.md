meaning_light  = "Outperforming your peers. Winning a competition. Being recognized as a capable person. Having your “moment in the spotlight.” Being cheered on by the crowd. Getting an award. Earning the admiration of others. Telling someone, “Good job!”"

meaning_shadow = "Being a bad winner. Allowing your achievements to inflate your ego. Looking down on people who seem less capable. Craving to be the center of attention. Giving or receiving insincere praise. Envying the achievements of others."

correspondence_planet 			= "Jupiter"
correspondence_astrological = "Leo"
correspondence_affirmation  = "I value sincere praise."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character scores a small victory, boosting his or her own spirits, but angering the opposition."

advice_relationships 	 = "How often do you praise your friend or partner? You may be underestimating how effective a few words of sincere affirmation can be. Recognition doesn’t have to be extravagant; often, all someone needs is a quiet expression of your appreciation."

advice_work 					 = "In the rush to get work done, your personal contributions may be celebrated—or overlooked. Recognized or not, your skills have value. If you get a moment in the sun, bask in it. If not, don’t allow yourself to be embittered when others get the recognition you feel you deserved."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Offer service quietly, and accept recognition with the same modest spirit. You aren’t working for the recognition, but there’s nothing wrong with allowing others to express the joy they take in the labor you provide."

advice_personal_growth = "Ultimately, the opinions of others won’t matter; you must, in the end, please yourself. What standards have you set? To what extent are you meeting them? Recognition is sweet…but meeting or exceeding your own personal criteria for success is even sweeter!"

advice_fortune_telling = "Someone is planning a party for you, but not everyone feels so good about your recent success. Watch out for envious friends."

questions	= ["Does your current level of performance warrant recognition?", "When others are victorious, how do you respond?", "What kind of recognition do you crave? Why?", "What external signals of recognition are you looking for?", "How freely do I praise the achievements of others?", "What happens when the parade is over?"]
