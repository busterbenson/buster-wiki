meaning_light  = "Putting a plan into motion. Taking that critical first step. Making good things happen. Going beyond your limits. Blazing new trails. Hitting the ground running. Seeing your plans come to fruition."

meaning_shadow = "Procrastinating. Knowing what to do, but refusing to do it. Launching a project without a clear definition of who should do what. Rejecting an opportunity to try something new. Failing to finish what you start."

correspondence_affirmation  = "I take the steps necessary to put my plans in action."
correspondence_story 				= "The main character’s initial plans are laid and launched."

advice_relationships 	 = "Knowing what you want or need does you no good if you don’t come up with a plan for achieving it! It’s time to expand your horizons: go places you’ve never been, try sports you’ve never tried, meet people you’ve overlooked. As your world expands, so do your opportunities."

advice_work 					 = "Lead by doing. Forge ahead with your plans, but don’t forget to show others what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. Be proactive, brainstorming obstacles and minting solutions before breakdowns occur. Define very clearly your criteria for success and measure progress daily."

advice_spirituality 	 = "Rather than look for a guru or a well-worn path, take the spiritual initiative. If you could express your spirituality in any way, what form would you choose? If you could worship anywhere, where would you go? Break the mold. Remember: bearing new fruit takes time."

advice_personal_growth = "Routine is the enemy of growth. Take new roads. See new sights. Pick a new hobby. Order the menu items you don’t recognize. Make a habit of blazing new trails."

advice_fortune_telling = "You’ll be planning a trip soon. Be on the lookout: your ship is coming in."

questions	= ["How can you make a habit of breaking your habits?", "How can you be a decisive leader in this circumstance?", "What’s your action plan for the next week, month, year, or decade?"]
