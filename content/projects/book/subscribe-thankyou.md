You should be receiving an email confirmation shortly with the free chapter to download. If you like it, I do hope you'll [buy the book](/whyareweyelling) from your favorite book store. If you send me a copy of the receipt, I'll send you some extra bonus stuff as well ([instructions here](/whyareweyelling)).

In the meantime, if you use Goodreads, could you do me a quick favor and mark **[Why Are We Yelling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44279111-why-are-we-yelling?ac=1&from_search=true)** as a book you "Want to Read" or are "Currently Reading"? It'll help others discover the book!

Thank you!
