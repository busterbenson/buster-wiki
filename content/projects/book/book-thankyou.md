I put my heart and soul into the ideas within these pages, and I hope it speaks to you regardless of your political, religious, or other affiliations. 

I don’t care if you’re a morning person or a night person, a butter-side-up or butter-side-down person, a rich or poor person, a child or elder. If you agree with the ideas in this book, I encourage you to practice them and lead by example.
