This is an idea coined by {{< link_to person="Robin Sloan" >}} in his book Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.

I started my own Codex in 2012. It began as [a public Github repository](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md) so that I could track (and be accountable) to my own beliefs. As of the end of 2018, the "source of truth" is now here on this site: <a href="/beliefs">My beliefs</a>.
