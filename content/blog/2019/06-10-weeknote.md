### I said last week would be good if...

*I connect with a few more people who want to be early book readers and/or blurbers.*
üëç I sent another handful of emails to people and got a handful of commitments to read. This continues to be the highest anxiety activity of my weeks. I love building social capital with people but I really dislike spending it. You could say I'm a social capital horder.

*I start making a plan for {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} development.*
üëç This is under way! Kellianne and I met last Monday and have a tentative schedule for development. Our plan is to launch an alpha in September, a beta in December, and to swap out the sites early next year. I have a [placeholder page here](https://new.750words.com) with the high level timeline.

*I start a new healthy living plan. (I was diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension, and have no interest in dying of a heart attack anytime soon.)*
üëç Officially started on a new healthy living plan this week. It's good timing for me to focus on health stuff because I'm in a transition phase with project and that means my schedule is open for fiddling. My goal is to lose about 20 pounds and to get into generally better shape over the next 6 months. As I'm prone to do, I'm planning to go "all in & with the flow" on health, which means changing my schedule to fit more exercise in, and removing every obstacle in my way so that it's more convenient to be healthy than to be any other way.

### This week will be good if...

*I turn in my manuscript with all the copy edits incorporated and all 450 comments addressed.*

*I do at least 20 minutes on the Peloton every day.*

*I decide on a text editor to build on for V2 of {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}}.*
