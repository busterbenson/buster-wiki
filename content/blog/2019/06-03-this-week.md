### What went well since the last update...

1. Reached out to a few people interested in being early book readers. 
2. [Published my annual review](https://medium.com/@buster/43-all-in-with-the-flow-e61e55b5dcf0). Motto for this year: All in & with the flow. 
2. [Published an epic update to the cognitive bias cheat sheet](https://medium.com/better-humans/what-can-we-do-about-our-bias-73c16eeb7dca?source=friends_link&sk=effd9e4c475f379c5b04e7eeccf305ac).
3. [Created a web-version of Pocket Biases](/biases). Now with a search box!
4. [Chatted with 3 people about their versions of Life in Weeks](/the-life-of/buster/). This was super fun. 

### This will be a good week if...

1. I connect with a few more people who want to be early book readers and/or blurbers.
2. I start making a plan for {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} development.
3. I start a new healthy living plan. (I was diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension, and have no interest in dying of a heart attack anytime soon.)
