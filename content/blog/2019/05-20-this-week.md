I'm taking this week to continue to bask in the enjoyment of turning in my manuscript last week. I want to move as slowly as I can on the hedonic treadmill that normalizes all moments of FIERO! (triumph over adversity or challenge) and reverts us back to our baseline happiness levels. There are so few moments where the things we anticipate in the future actually pass through the window of the present moment and can be experienced directly. So that's my top priority this week.

As I do that I am also aware of the backlog of deferred projects that have been so patiently waiting for a chance to be considered. The one I'm currently most excited about returning to is {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}}. I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/750words/posts/10157598700234274" target="_blank">posted an update</a> in the 750 Words Facebook group, and have a giant board in Asana of things that I want to fix or improve about that site. I've been taking the <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/courses" target="_blank">Vue Mastery courses</a> after deciding to build the new site in Vue. These frameworks have come a long way in the last 10 years.

I'm also having a ton of fun playing with my {{< link_to life-of="buster" text="Life in Weeks" >}} page, and have 3 interviews this week with people who want to try to build their own version of this page. That'll give me a good sense for the kinds of edge cases that might come up if I ever wanted to turn this into a tiny side project.

As for book-related work, I'm starting to send out my manuscript to some people who might be interested in being early readers and maybe even offering blurbs. It's fun to have an excuse to reach out to a bunch of people I like.

### This will be a good week if...

1. I connect with a few people who want to be early readers
2. I start making a plan for {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} development
3. I interview a few people for {{< link_to project="The Life Of" >}} pages
