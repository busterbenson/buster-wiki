This is a series of weekly answers to the question **"This week will be good if..."**, with results from the following week. Inspired by [this write-up by Matt Webb](https://medium.com/job-garden/a-pre-history-of-weeknotes-plus-why-i-write-them-and-perhaps-why-you-should-too-week-16-31a4a5cbf7b0), [this article about the why of weeknotes](https://productforthepeople.xyz/the-why-of-weeknotes-c1cd98967842), and the [weeknot.es](https://weeknot.es/) community on Medium. My version of it here is a simple weekly summary of my time spent in my creative rickshaw (aka independent creative projects with the goal of becoming financially sustainable). The data about "how the previous week went" and "how this week began" comes from taking Gyroscope's "Mood Score" test as I write this each week. Each week also gets an animal or other emoji that begins with incrementing letters of the alphabet.

### 06.24.2019: Week of the Elephant 🐘 {#week-06-24-2019}

**How the previous week went:** 

- *When the previous week began:* 93 (happy, strong, friendly, calm)
- *When this week began:* 87 (happy, strong, friendly)

**This week will be good if:**

*I write to at least 3 more people about giving blurbs for my book (Continued 4x).*

*I exercise for at least 30 minutes on 3 or more days (Continued 3x).*

*I work on V2 of {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} for at least 5 hours (Take 3).*

### 06.17.2019: Week of the Duck 🦆 {#week-06-17-2019}

**How the previous week went:** 

- *When the previous week began:* 100 (happy, strong, friendly, calm)
- *When this week began:* 93 (happy, strong, friendly, calm)

**This week will be good if:**

*I write to at least 6 more people about giving blurbs for my book (Continued 3x).*

- 👎 I talked to a couple new people, and continued conversations with a couple people from the past few weeks, but didn't get to 6 new people. This whole process is stressing me out more than it should, and I had a productive conversation with my agent about this and got some perspective on the relative importance of this to other activities we'll be doing later on that I'm much more comfortable with. 

*I ride the Peloton at least 120 minutes (Continued 2x).*

- 👌 I got 105 minutes total this week, which seemed like plenty, given that I'm also doing 30-40 minute exercises through [future.fit](http://future.fit). I'm gonna lower this goal for the next week in the hopes of making it easy to hit even when new routines haven't quite set in yet.

*I decide on a text editor to build on for V2 of {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} (Take 2).*

- 👎 I didn't make progress on this again. I ended up spending more time working on the higher-level ideas and plans than in the code this week. I'll continue this goal but make it a bit more vague to account for the fuzzy discovery phase I'm in.

### 06.10.2019: Week of the Crocodile 🐊 {#week-06-10-2019}

**How the previous week went:** 

- *When the previous week began:* 82 (happy, strong, worried)
- *When this week began:* 100 (happy, strong, friendly, calm)

**This week will be good if:**

*I turn in my manuscript with all the copy edits incorporated and all 450 comments addressed.*

- 👍 I did this, though it was a bit rushed at the end. Some of this work feels a bit like Zeno's paradox... while I can get closer and closer to the end, I feel like I'm approaching an asymptote where each revision comes more likely of needed to be revised again in the future, generating work that approaches infinite. I guess that's a good place to begin to think that I'm "done" for now. 
- This metaphor was inspired by this tweet: {{< tweet "1140681273725206528" >}}

*I do at least 20 minutes on the Peloton every day.*

- 👍 I didn't ride every day, but I did ride 5/7 days for a total of 135 minutes, which adds up to about the same (18 minutes a day). I'm pretty happy with the Peloton so far, especially the convenience factor of being able to go to another room in the house and do a quick ride. 

*I decide on a text editor to build on for V2 of {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}}.*

- 👎 I didn't make progress on this last week. So will push it to this coming week.

### 06.03.2019: Week of the Boar 🐗 {#week-06-03-2019}

**This week will be good if:**

*I connect with a few more people who want to be early book readers and/or blurbers.*

- 👍 I sent another handful of emails to people and got a handful of commitments to read. This continues to be the highest anxiety activity of my weeks. I love building social capital with people but I really dislike spending it. You could say I'm a social capital horder.

*I start making a plan for {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} development.*

- 👍 This is under way! Kellianne and I met last Monday and have a tentative schedule for development. Our plan is to launch an alpha in September, a beta in December, and to swap out the sites early next year. I have a [placeholder page here](https://new.750words.com) with the high level timeline.

*I start a new healthy living plan. (I was diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension, and have no interest in dying of a heart attack anytime soon.)*

- 👍 Officially started on a new healthy living plan this week. It's good timing for me to focus on health stuff because I'm in a transition phase with project and that means my schedule is open for fiddling. My goal is to lose about 20 pounds and to get into generally better shape over the next 6 months. As I'm prone to do, I'm planning to go "all in & with the flow" on health, which means changing my schedule to fit more exercise in, and removing every obstacle in my way so that it's more convenient to be healthy than to be any other way.

### 05.20.2019: Week of the Ant 🐜 {#week-05-20-2019}

I'm taking this week to continue to bask in the enjoyment of turning in my manuscript last week. I want to move as slowly as I can on the hedonic treadmill that normalizes all moments of FIERO! (triumph over adversity or challenge) and reverts us back to our baseline happiness levels. There are so few moments where the things we anticipate in the future actually pass through the window of the present moment and can be experienced directly. So that's my top priority this week.

As I do that I am also aware of the backlog of deferred projects that have been so patiently waiting for a chance to be considered. The one I'm currently most excited about returning to is {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}}. I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/750words/posts/10157598700234274" target="_blank">posted an update</a> in the 750 Words Facebook group, and have a giant board in Asana of things that I want to fix or improve about that site. I've been taking the <a href="https://www.vuemastery.com/courses" target="_blank">Vue Mastery courses</a> after deciding to build the new site in Vue. These frameworks have come a long way in the last 10 years.

I'm also having a ton of fun playing with my {{< link_to life-of="buster" text="Life in Weeks" >}} page, and have 3 interviews this week with people who want to try to build their own version of this page. That'll give me a good sense for the kinds of edge cases that might come up if I ever wanted to turn this into a tiny side project.

As for book-related work, I'm starting to send out my manuscript to some people who might be interested in being early readers and maybe even offering blurbs. It's fun to have an excuse to reach out to a bunch of people I like.

**This week will be good if:**

*I connect with a few people who want to be early readers.*

- 👍 I reached out to a few people interested in being early book readers. 

*I start making a plan for {{< link_to project="750 Words" >}} development.*

- 👎 This didn't happen. 

*I interview a few people for {{< link_to project="The Life Of" >}} pages.*

- 👍 I [chatted with 3 people about their versions of Life in Weeks](/the-life-of/buster/). This was super fun.
